# C# 9 Record and Pattern Matching Examples

## Overview
This repository contains examples demonstrating the usage of C# 9 features such as Records and Pattern Matching. The code showcases how to write concise and readable C# code using these powerful language features.

*  [This Repo Article by Ziggy Rafiq is on C# Corner](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/record-and-pattern-matching-in-c-sharp-9-writing-c-sharp-code-that-is-concise-and-readabl/).

## Project Structure

### 1. `PatternMatching.Models` Namespace
   - `Shape` class representing a simple geometric shape with width and height properties.

### 2. `PatternMatching` Namespace
   - `ShapeInfo` static class with a method for obtaining a textual description of a given shape.

### 3. `Data` Class
   - Contains examples illustrating the use of C# 9 features.

## Examples

### Immutable by Default - `Data.Person` Record
```csharp
var person1 = new Person("John", "Doe");
var person2 = new Person("John", "Doe");

if (person1 == person2)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Both persons are equal.");
}

var person = new Person("Jane", "Doe");
var (firstName, lastName) = person;
Console.WriteLine($"First Name: {firstName}, Last Name: {lastName}");
``` 

### Type Patterns - Data.GetDisplayText Method
```csharp
string strExample = "I am Ziggy Rafiq!";
int intExample = 32;
DateTime dateTimeExample = DateTime.Now;
double doubleExample = 3.14;
bool boolExample = true;

Console.WriteLine(GetDisplayText(strExample));
Console.WriteLine(GetDisplayText(intExample));
Console.WriteLine(GetDisplayText(dateTimeExample));
Console.WriteLine(GetDisplayText(doubleExample));
Console.WriteLine(GetDisplayText(boolExample));
```

### Property Patterns - ShapeInfo.GetShapeDescription Method
```csharp
// Example 1: Point
Shape point = new Shape { Width = 0, Height = 0 };
Console.WriteLine(ShapeInfo.GetShapeDescription(point));  // Output: Point

// Example 2: Square
Shape square = new Shape { Width = 5, Height = 5 };
Console.WriteLine(ShapeInfo.GetShapeDescription(square));  // Output: Square with side 5

// Example 3: Rectangle
Shape rectangle = new Shape { Width = 3, Height = 7 };
Console.WriteLine(ShapeInfo.GetShapeDescription(rectangle));  // Output: Rectangle with width 3 and height 7

// Example 4: Unknown Shape
Shape unknownShape = new Shape { Width = 2, Height = 4 };
Console.WriteLine(ShapeInfo.GetShapeDescription(unknownShape));  // Output: Unknown Shape
```
